# Capstone

## Overview
This project requires you to create an asynchronous web app that uses Web API and user data to dynamically update the UI. This will be a travel app where you can include date and location you want to visit. This will then return an image, and the expected weather for the location. The added functionality to this project is that it displays the end date of the trip.
